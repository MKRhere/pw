## MKRhere/pw

This is my personal website, acts as both a portfolio and a personal space. You can visit the website at https://mkr.pw, or take a look around here.

## Building

I've used Sass for styling and CommonJS modules to keep my code maintainable. I've added a `build.js` to keep it easy to build for production. After cloning the repo, do

```shell
npm install
npm install --only=dev
node build
```

The assets for the site are built at `/docs/`
